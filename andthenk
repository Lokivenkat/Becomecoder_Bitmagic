ques: n&(n-1)&(n-2)&(n-3)......(n-k)=0
we need to find k value when this becomes 0

ans: to find that first we have to calculate nearest pre two power value and print -1 of that two power value.This will be our answer.
To find nearest two power we have to do right shift a number until it becomes 0 and count the iterations,and after counting we have to do 
**1<<count-1 to get pre two power value**
**1<<count to get post two power value**
#why we find two power
ans: when we making & with next number only two power values will getting 0's  

n=int(input())
count=0
while(n):
    n=n>>1
    count+=1
posttwopower=1<<count
pretwopower=1<<count-1
print(posttwopower,pretwopower) #to find two powers(pre and post)
print(pretwopower-1) #ans

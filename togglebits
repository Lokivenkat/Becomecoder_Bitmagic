Toggle bits given range 

Given a non-negative number N and two values L and R. The problem is to toggle the bits in the range L to R in the binary representation of N, i.e, to toggle bits from the rightmost Lth bit to the rightmost Rth bit. A toggle operation flips a bit 0 to 1 and a bit 1 to 0. Print N after the bits are toggled.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 17 , L = 2 , R = 3
Output:
23
Explanation:
(17)10 = (10001)2.  After toggling all
the bits from 2nd to 3rd position we get
(10111)2 = (23)10

class Solution:
    def toggleBits(self, N , L , R):
        for i in range(L,R+1):
            N=N^(1<<(i-1))
        return(N)

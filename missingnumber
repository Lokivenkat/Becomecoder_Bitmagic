268. Missing Number
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        i=0
        while(i<len(nums)):
            if(nums[i]^i):
                return(i)
            else:
                i+=1
        return(i)

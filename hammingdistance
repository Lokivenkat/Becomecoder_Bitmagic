461. Hamming Distance
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

 Example 1:

Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

class Solution:
    def hammingDistance(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        ans=x^y
        count=0
        while(ans!=0):
            if(ans&1):
                count+=1
            ans=ans>>1
        return(count)
